#Q1. Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
print("Hello World!")

Output:
Hello, World!

#Q2. Create variables to store your name, age, and favourite hobby. Print these variables.
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
favorite_hobby = "Reading"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Favorite Hobby:", favorite_hobby)

Output:
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Favorite Hobby: Reading

#Q3. Add comments to your code explaining what each line does.

# Storing the variables
name = "John Doe"        # This line stores the name as a string in the variable 'name'
age = 25                 # This line stores the age as an integer in the variable 'age'
favorite_hobby = "Reading"  # This line stores the favorite hobby as a string in the variable 'favorite_hobby'

# Printing the variables
print("Name:", name)           # This line prints the text "Name:" followed by the value stored in 'name'
print("Age:", age)             # This line prints the text "Age:" followed by the value stored in 'age'
print("Favorite Hobby:", favorite_hobby)  # This line prints the text "Favorite Hobby:" followed by the value stored in 'favorite_hobby'

#Q4. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. 

number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

Output:
Enter an integer: 5
The number is positive.

#Q5. Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

Output:
Enter a year: 2024
2024 is a leap year.

#Q6. Write a Python program to print the first 10 natural numbers using a for loop.

for i in range(1, 11):  # The range function generates numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
    print(i)

Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

#Q7.Create a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number using a while loop.

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(f"{number} x {i} = {number * i}")
    i += 1  # Incrementing the counter

Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50

#Q8. Write a Python program that iterates through numbers 1 to 10 and prints each number. Use the continue statement to skip numbers that are divisible by 3.

for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        continue;
    print(i)

Output:
1
2
4
5
7
8
10

#Q9. Create a program that stops printing numbers when it encounters a number greater than 5 using the break statement.

for i in range(1, 11):
    if i > 5:
        break;
    print(i)

Output:
1
2
3
4
5

#Q10. Define a function called greet that takes a name as an argument and prints "Hello, [name]!".

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
greet("Alice");

Output:
Hello, Alice!

#Q11. Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2;
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)

Output:
The sum is: 8
